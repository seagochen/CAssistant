## Why Makefile? 

Makefile is really hard to learn and maintain. So I developed this new tool and named it Tora, means the tiger.

Tora does the same thing which Makefile was. It's developed based on Python 3 (both v3.6 and v3.7 works well), and its source code very easy to read. 

## How to use it?

1. Click tab of **[release](https://github.com/seagochen/Tora/releases)** select the recently version and download.

2. Please use **pip3** to install the Tora's dependency library->**siki** before you trying to compile source code.

```
    pip3 install siki
```

3. Place Tora under your source code.

4. Setup the configure file and run Makefile.

5. Wait for a moment.

6. Done!


## What needs to be noted?

Currently, Tora supports Linux and MacOS only. Because I haven't enough time to let it suit Windows. 

If you may do me a favor, and contribute your code to let it works with Windows.

## What a sample?

This project already shows you a good sample. Any question is welcome.
