Why Makefile? 

It's very hard to maintain and learning. So I developed this new utility and named it as Tora, the tiger.

Tora does the same thing which Makefile was. It's developed based on Python 3, therefore, things looks better and easier.

Tora is very easy to use and learn, project settings located to `project.conf` file. To run this script is just same as Makefile, the `./compile.sh`

Unfortunately, Tora it only supports Linux and Darwin platforms now, if you are willing to help and contribute your code to let it available to Windows, it will be fun and cool.

I thought, it now is a prototype, not much power than what you expected, open an issue if you want some new features or report a bug.

## Wannar a sample?

Go and check another project of mine, see the `Triangle`.
