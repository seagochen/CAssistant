## Why Makefile? 

Makefile is really hard to learn and maintain. So I developed this new tool and named it Tora, means the tiger.

Tora does the same thing which Makefile was. It's developed based on Python 3 (both v3.6 and v3.7 works well), and its source code very easy to read. 

## How to use it?

* First, use the **pip3** to install the Tora:

```
    pip3 install tora
```

* For linux and MacOS users, please place the **tora.linux.sh** file to PATH or put it to the /usr/bin/, and rename it to tora.sh.

* To new a empty project, like:

```
    tora.sh new {solution name}
```

* Put your C/C++ codes to the directory.

* Edit both xml files.

* To build your project under the folder, like:

```
    tora.sh build
```

* To package your outputs, like:

```
    tora.sh package
```

## What needs to be noted?

Currently, Tora supports Linux and MacOS only. This project is free to use, and based on the license of GPLv3.
You're welcome to contribute code here!

## What a sample?

This project already shows you a good sample. Any question is welcome.
