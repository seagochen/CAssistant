Why Makefile? 

I thought Makefile is hard to learn and maintain. So I developed this new tool and named it as Japanese tiger, the Tora.

Tora does the same thing which Makefile was. It's developed based on Python 3, therefore, code could be easier to read. For more information and how let it works, please look at my other projects which using tora as project management.

As far as right now, Tora it only supports Linux and Darwin platforms, if you are willing to help and contribute your code to let it works with Windows, things will be fun and cool.

## Wannar a sample?

Go and check the project of mine, see the `Triangle` for more details.
